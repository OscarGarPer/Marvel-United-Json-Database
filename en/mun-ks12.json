After being orphaned at five and buried under stone in the accident, she developed severe claustrophobia. With no one to help her, she became a skilled thief trained by Achmed El Mbar. She unknowingly picked Professor Xavier's pocket and he discovered her true powers. When he was finally able to recruit her, he dubbed her Storm and convinced her that her mutant powers of weather manipulation could help the world. She fought valiantly with the X-Men.",
