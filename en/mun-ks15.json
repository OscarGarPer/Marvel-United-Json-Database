Xavier brought him to his school and trained him as the third original X-Men member. He dropped the Avenging part of his name and just went by Angel. Having been born with a silver spoon and the entitlement that accompanies it, he worried little about showing off his feathered wings and ability to fly in public. But he was a valued member of the original team.",
